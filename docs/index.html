  <p>
    This archive prioritizes accuracy, repeatable structure, and long-term usability.
    Completed seasons are treated as <strong>historical artifacts</strong>, not living documents.

    <p class="kicker">Recognition Principle</p>
<div class="article">
  <p>
    A long-term goal of this project is to recognize
    <strong>every athlete who has suited up for Meade County High School athletics</strong>,
    at any level, where records exist.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not all athletes will have complete statistical records.
    In many cases, recognition may be limited to roster inclusion,
    season participation, or contemporaneous mention.
  </p>
  <p>
    The absence of statistics should not be interpreted as the absence of participation.
