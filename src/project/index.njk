  <p class="kicker">Project Scope</p>
  <p>
    The MCHS Sports Almanac is a long-term historical and statistical archive of
    Meade County High School athletics, maintained for reporting, research, and
    historical preservation purposes.
  </p>

  <p class="kicker">Recognition Principle</p>
  <p>
    A long-term goal of this project is to recognize
    <strong>every athlete who has suited up for Meade County High School athletics</strong>,
    at any level, where records exist.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not all athletes will have complete statistical records. In many cases,
    recognition may be limited to roster inclusion, season participation,
    or contemporaneous mention.
  </p>
  <p>
    The absence of statistics should not be interpreted as the absence of participation.
  </p>

  <p class="kicker">Data Philosophy</p>
  <p>
    This archive values participation and contribution, not just measurable outcomes.
    Statistical completeness varies by era, sport, and source.
